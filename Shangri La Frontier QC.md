# Shangri La Frontier QC

## EP1

- [ ] 04:24 - Sign says "Kuon Amane", when it should be "Towa", GER Subs Correct. Eng Subs needs Tracking and GER subs missing a bit contextual info on signs.
  - [ ] Sign thats missing for GER: `Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.87,0:04:26.12,Sign_Basic,sign,0,0,0,,{\fs36\c&HA493CB&\3c&HCFD1CC&\shad0\frz319.5\fscx80\pos(948,690)}The Celebrity Model on Fashion's Bleeding Edge`
  - [x] ~~Half fixed sign for (no tracking) ENG: `Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.87,0:04:26.12,Sign_Basic,sign,0,0,0,,{\c&HC589AA&\fnArial\b1\blur0.5\fax0.616342\fscx102.36\fscy148.12\frz25.9594\frx4.5549\fry3.3439\xbord0.00\ybord0.00\org(495.79,537.5)\pos(471.18,595.27)}Towa Amane`~~ Fixed https://github.com/Vodes/SLF/tree/76b8688827afb4cf8d0d10711e9acec4182629d4
  - [ ] Tracking (sign is 'fine' without it, just looks real bad.)

- [ ] 12:11 - GER Subs might want to pinch the better ENG TS here for all of the character creation sequence.
- [ ] 16:06 - GER Subs pinch ENG TS, for bit more after this point too.
